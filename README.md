# Racket syntax highlighter test

This file contains most of the valid Racket forms listed in the article [The Reader](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/reader.html#%28part._parse-comment%29) in Racket reference (and some invalid ones too, to catch common mistakes). Is is intented to be used as a test of syntax-highlighting capabilities in various editors.

I created it mainly to test my own [Magic Racket](https://github.com/Eugleo/magic-racket) extension, but I figured it might be of use to others as well â€” plus it revealed some holes in the GitHub's own highlighting as well.
